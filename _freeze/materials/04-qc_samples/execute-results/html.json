Variants with a high fraction of missing data may indicate overall low quality for that sample and thus be removed from downstream analysis.\n- **Heterozygosity**: The fraction of SNVs that are heterozygous in a given sample. We expect most individuals to have a mixture of both homozygous and heterozygous SNVs. Outliers may indicate genotyping errors. \n- **Relatedness**: Individuals who are related to each other (e.g. siblings, cousins, parents and children) may affect the association test results and create false positive hits. It is therefore good to assess if there are potential close family members before proceeding.  \n- **Discordant sex**: In humans, we expect males to have only one X chromosome and thus no heterozygous variants, while the converse is true for females. This expectation can be used to identify potential mis-matches and correct them before proceeding.\n\nWe will cover each of these below. \n\n:::{.callout-important}\n#### Set up your R session\n\nIf you haven't done so already, start an R session with the following packages loaded: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse) # data manipulation\nlibrary(patchwork) # to compose plots\nlibrary(janitor)   # to clean column names\ntheme_set(theme_minimal()) # change default ggplot2 theme\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Call rates\n\nSimilarly to what we did for variants, we can calculate how many missing genotypes each individual sample has. \nThis can then be used to assess the need to exclude samples from downstream analyses. \n\nThere are no set rules as to what constitutes a \"good call rate\", but typically we may exclude samples with greater than ~5% of missing genotypes. \nThis threshold may vary, however, depending on the nature of data you have. \n\nAs we saw before, the option `--missing` generates missingness files for both samples and variants, so we don't need to re-run the PLINK command.\nHowever, here it is as a reminder: \n\n```bash\nplink2 \\\n  --pfile data/plink/1000G_subset \\\n  --out results/1000G_subset \\\n  --missing\n```\n\nFor the sample missingness report the file extension is `.smiss`, which we can import into R as usual:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmiss <- read_tsv(\"results/1000G_subset.smiss\") |> \n  clean_names(replace = c(\"#\" =

.cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  408   629 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAround 61% of our samples have missing data in at least one of the variants. \n\nFor those samples with some missing data, we can check the distribution of the fraction of missing genotypes:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmiss |> \n  filter(f_miss > 0) |> \n  ggplot(aes(f_miss)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-qc_samples_files/figure-html/smiss-hist-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFrom this distribution it seems that most individuals have a low fraction of missing genotypes, indicating no problematic samples. \n\nA filter is probably not even necessary in this case, as no sample seems to have more than 5% missing data. \nIn any case, individuals with high rates of missing data, e.g. using the 5% threshold, can be excluded using PLINK's option `--mind 0.05`. \n\n\n## Heterozygosity and inbreeding\n\nAnother useful metric to assess issues with sample quality is to look at the fraction of variants that are heterozygous, or conversely what the **inbreeding coefficient** of each individual is. \nIn general, we expect an individual to have both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. \nIndividuals with high heterozygosity may represent poor quality samples (e.g. contaminated samples composed of a mixture of DNA from two individuals). \nConversely, individuals with high homozygosity may indicate inbreeding, which can impact the balance of allele frequencies in the population (as discussed in the [Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium section](03-qc_variants.qmd#hardy–weinberg)) and potentially bias the results of our association tests. \n\nThere isn't necessarily a clear value, but within a population we should expect the distribution of heterozygosity to be consistent across individuals. \nIf an individual is an outlier (e.g. with too many homozygous or heterozygous sites), then we may infer some quality issues may have ocurred with that sample. \n\nPLINK can calculate per-sample heterozygosity rates using the option `--het`:\n\n```bash\nplink2 \\\n  --pfile data/plink/1000G_subset \\\n  --out results/1000G_subset \\\n  --extract results/1000G_subset.prune.in \\\n  --geno 0.05 --maf 0.01 --mind 0.05 \\\n  --het\n```\n\nIn this command we also apply the variant filters defined in the [variant QC section](03-qc_variants.qmd). \nNamely, retaining genotypes and samples with a call rate of at least 95% (`--geno 0.05 --mind 0.05`) and minor allele frequency of at least 1% (`--maf 0.01`).\nAnd use the `--extract` option to only include uncorrelated variants, obtained by LD prunning.\n\nThe output file has extension `.het`, which we can import into R:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhet <- read_tsv(\"results/1000G_subset.het\") |> \n  clean_names(replace = c(\"#\" = \"\"))\n\nhead(het)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A

`o_hom` is the number of observed homozygous genotypes.\n- `e_hom` is the expected number of homozygous genotypes, based on the allele frequencies in the population and under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\n- `obs_ct` is the number of non-missing genotypes.\n- `f` is the inbreeding coefficient, which represent the individual heterozygosity relative to the expectation under HWE (see box below for details on its calculation). \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Inbreeding coefficient calculation\n\nLet's call $H_{obs}$ the observed fraction of heterozygote variants in an individual and $H_{exp}$ the expected heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient is usually defined as:\n\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{H_{obs}}{H_{exp}}\n$$\n\nI.e., it is the difference between the expected and observed heterozygosity, divided by the expected heterozygosity.\n\n- A value of 0 would indicate that the individual is heterozygous at the expected rate, since $H_{obs} = H_{exp}$.\n- A value of 1 would indicate that the individual is completely homozygous, since $H_{obs} = 0$.\n- If $H_{obs} < H_{exp}$, then the inbreeding coefficient will be between 0 and 1, indicating different levels of homozygosity or inbreeding.\n- If $H_{obs} > H_{exp}$, then the individual is more heterozygous than expected under HWE and the inbreeding coefficient takes negative values.\n\nRather than reporting the observed and expected heterozygosity, PLINK reports things as counts of homozygous variants. \nBecause all of these can be calculated from each other, we can rearrange the equation above to express the inbreeding coefficient in terms of the number of homozygous genotypes.\n\nLet's call $O_{hom}$ the number of observed homozygous genotypes, $E_{exp}$ the number of expected homozygous genotypes and $O_{total}$ the total number of variants.\nThen, the equation above could be written as:\n\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{O_{total} - O_{hom}}{O_{total} - E_{hom}}\n$$\n\nWhich we can further rearrange to:\n\n$$\nF = \\frac{O_{hom} - E_{hom}}{O_{total} - E_{hom}}\n$$\n\nWe can confirm this is how PLINK calculates the inbreeding value:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhet |> \n  mutate(f2 = (o_hom - e_hom) / (obs_ct - e_hom))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1,037 ×

the expected rate, while a value of 1 indicates that the individual is completely homozygous.\nNegative values indicate that the individual is more heterozygous than expected under HWE.\n\nWe can make a histogram of the inbreeding coefficient:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhet |> \n  ggplot(aes(f)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-qc_samples_files/figure-html/het-histogram-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn general we can see there are no individuals with very extreme inbreeding values (e.g. close to 1). \nWe can see some individuals with slightly negative values, indicating they are more heterozygous than expected under HWE.\n\nThe main issue we see is that the distribution is multi-modal.\nThis indicates that we have different groups of samples, some with higher rates of inbreeding and others with lower rates. \n\nThis is likely a consequence of the fact we have individuals from different populations (geographic areas). \nThis is an issue we will come back to in the **population structure** chapter. \n\nFor now, it is clear that we cannot easily filter samples based on their heterozygosity, as the populations are heterogeneous. \n\n<!-- \n### Stratifying the analysis by population\n\nIdeally, we should calculate the inbreeding coefficient separately for each population, as the HWE assumes that the population is homogenous.\nWe can do this by using the `--keep-if` option in PLINK, which allows us to specify a condition on which to keep individuals.\n\nIf we examine our `.psam` file, we can see that the population is specified in the last column and a \"super population\" in the third column:\n\n```bash\nhead -n 5 data/plink/1000G_subset.psam\n```\n\n```\n#IID     SEX  SuperPop  Population\nHG00097  2    EUR       GBR\nHG00107  1    EUR       GBR\nHG00108  1    EUR       GBR\nHG00109  1    EUR       GBR\n```\n\nWe can see how many individuals we have in each population (country):\n\n```bash\ntail -n +2 data/plink/1000G_subset.psam | cut -f 4 | sort | uniq -c\n```\n\n```\n37 ACB\n22 ASW\n43 BEB\n34 CDX\n40 CEU\n\n... more lines ommitted ...\n```\n\nAnd in each continent (super population):\n\n```bash\ntail -n +2 data/plink/1000G_subset.psam | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c\n```\n\n```\n273 AFR\n140 AMR\n207 EAS\n208 EUR\n209 SAS\n```\n\nAs we have less than 100 individuals in each country, let's focus on the super populations and hope that those are more homogenous than the entire population of samples.\nFor example, to calculate the inbreeding coefficient for individuals from the EUR population, we can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nplink2 \\\n  --pfile data/plink/1000G_subset \\\n  --out results/1000G_subset_EUR \\\n  --keep-if \"SuperPop == EUR\" \\\n  --extract results/1000G_subset.prune.in \\\n  --geno 0.05 --maf 0.01 --mind 0.05 \\\n  --het\n```\n\nLet's consider the distribution of inbreeding coefficients for this population:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhet_eur <- read_tsv(\"results/1000G_subset_EUR.het\") |> \n

reasonably normal distribution.\nWe can see some individuals who migth be potential outliers, which we will exclude after considering the other populations. \n\nHere is how we could automate the process of calculating the inbreeding coefficient for all populations:\n\n```bash\n# get the list of populations\npopulations=$(tail -n +2 data/plink/1000G_subset.psam | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq)\n\n#

Excluding very close relatives is best-practice to avoid biasing downstream association tests.\n  - To exlude individuals above a certain kinship score threshold use `--king-cutoff X` (replace `X` with the desired threshold). Common thresholds include 1/4 for full siblings, 1/8 for second degree relatives and 1/16 for third degree relatives. \n- Discordant sex (`--check-sex`): it is good practice to check if the sex assigned to the individual (specified in the `.psam`/`.fam` file) matches the sex from genetic data. This can be determined from genotypes in the sex chromosomes. Individual with discordant sex may either be corrected or removed from the analysis. \n:::\n",
