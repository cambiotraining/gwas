p}\n$$\n\nTaking a concrete example, if our trait is \"type 2 diabetes\", the odds represents the probability change in having this condition, relative to not having it:\n\n$$\n\\text{Odds} = \\frac{\\text{probability diabetes}}{\\text{probability healthy}}\n$$\n\nAn odds ratio is then the ratio of odds between two groups. \nIn the context of GWAS, we report odds ratios per-allele increase, i.e. between a group that has 1 allele versus the group without that allele. \nTaking our T2D example and assuming the \"AA\" genotype is our reference group, then the odds ratio would be: \n\n$$\n\\text{Odds Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{odds diabetes for genotype AB}}{\\text{odds diabetes for genotype AA}}\n$$\n\nOne important thing to consider is that **odds ratios are multiplicative**.\nFor example, if the estimate for a given variant was OR = 3 per allele, the interpretation in terms of genotypes is:\n\n- Genotype AA: baseline group (carrying zero \"B\" alleles).\n- Genotype AB: 3 times more likely to have the condition than AA.\n- Genotype BB: 3Â² = 9 times more likely to have the condition than AA.\n\nThe **significance of association** in this case is assessed using a Wald Z-statistic, which similarly to the t-statistic discussed earlier, measures the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio of our OR estimate.\nAs usual, this is compared to a theoretical distribution to obtain a **p-value** for the association.\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n#### Effect sizes\n\nIn the examples given above we used relatively large effect sizes, for illustration purposes. \nFor complex traits the effects of individual variants might be quite small. \nFor example, for type 2 diabetes many found associations have OR of ~1.1 or even less. \nFor reference, this represents a probability of 52% of having the disease compared to 48% for not having it. \n\nThese are still substantial effects, but not as large as what we used in the examples above. \n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### Odds, log-odds and probabilities\n\nLogistic regression models can be challenging to interpret and working with odds is sometimes confusing. \nRemember, the odds is a ratio of two probabilities: the probability of an event happening versus it not happening. \n\nBecause of the underlying maths, logistic regression coefficients are usually given as log-odds. \nThis is exactly how it sounds like, it's the natural log of the odds ratio. \nThis is also known as the logit function.\n\nI can be useful to convert probabilities to odds (or log-odds) and back. \nSay an event has a 75% chance of happening. We can calculate odds and log-odds easily: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# if you know your probability\np <- 0.75\n\n# calculate odds as:\n0.75 / (1 - 0.75)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# and log-odds taking the natural log of the previous\nlog(0.75 / (1 - 0.75))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.098612\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you start from having the odds ratio, for example OR = 3, then you need to: \nfirst convert it to log-odds (or \"logit\"); then use the inverse-logit function to calculate the probability.\nHere's the R code: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# if you know your odds\nodds <- 3\n\n# calculate the probability of the event using the inverse-logit\nplogis(log(odds))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.75\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## P-value distribution\n\nIn addition to the genotype effect (Î² or OR), another output of the statistical association test is the p-value of the statistical test for its significance. \nThe association test is performed separately for each variant, so we get as many p-value as there are variants. \nOne of the first steps when analysing the outcome of an association test is to assess potential biases, which can be diagnosed by looking at the p-value distribution.\n\nIn statistical null hypothesis testing, there is a theoretical expectation that p-values follow a **uniform distribution** when no effect exists. \nA p-value of 0.01 is just as likely as a p-value of 0.99 - it's all just due to random chance.\nIn our case, this would mean no association between the trait and genotype. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of a distribution of p-values (10k tests) when the null hypothesis is always true.](06-stats_files/figure-html/pval-null-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a multiple testing scenario such as GWAS, where many tests being performed (one per variant), we would expect that most variants follow this uniform distribution. \n\nHowever, if some fraction of the variants are associated with the trait, this will skew the p-value distribution, leading to an excess of small p-values. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of a distribution of p-values when the null hypothesis is false (i.e. a \"statistically significant result\") for a fraction of the tests.](06-stats_files/figure-html/pval-sig-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThere is an excellent post in the _Variance Explained_ blog, with further discussions on this topic: [How to interpret a p-value histogram, by David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/interpreting-pvalue-histogram/).\n\n\n### Q-Q plots\n\nAnother way to assess the distribution of p-values is to produce a **Q-Q plot**, which is a type of scatterplot that compares the distribution of p-values under the expected uniform distribution and the actual observed p-values. \n\nFor Q-Q plots it is common to plot the p-values as $-log_{10}(p-value)$, which is a transformation that emphasises very small p-values. \nAs small p-values is what we expect to see for \"significant\" associations (and is what we're ultimately hoping to see!), this emphasises those very small values by transforming them into relatively large numbers. \n\nHere are the Q-Q plots of the expected-versus-observed $-log_{10}(p-value)$ for each of the distributions shown above:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-stats_files/figure-html/pval-qq-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe diagonal line indicates the expectation under the null hypothesis. \nAs we can see in the examples above, the plot on the left shows all points falling along the diagonal, indicating no significant associations. \nThe plot on the right, on the other hand, shows good fit for part of the distribution, but with an excess of small p-values as shown by a deviation of points towards the top of the graph. \n\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key Points\n\n- The statistical methods used for association analysis are based on linear regression models. \n- Quantitative traits are analysed using normal linear regression, whereas binary traits are modelled using binomial (logistic) regression. \n- The effect sizes of quantitative traits are reported as unit increase per allele and can be interpreted linearly. \n- The effect sizes of binary traits are reported as odds ratios per allele and are multiplicative. \n- In a multiple testing setting, p-values are expected to follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis. \n- In general, the distribution of the observed p-values should follow the uniform expectation, except for a few variants that are associated with the trait. \n  - Q-Q plots can be used to assess the expected versus observed p-value distributions. \n  - Large deviations from expectation may indicate biases in the analysis that lead to p-value inflation.\n- Due to multiple testing, a stringent p-value threshold is needed.\n  - For human GWAS p-value thresholds have been determined based on the general LD patterns observed across the human genome. \n:::\n",
